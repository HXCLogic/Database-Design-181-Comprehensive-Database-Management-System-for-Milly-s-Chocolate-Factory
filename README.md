# Database-Design-181-Comprehensive-Database-Management-System-for-Milly-s-Chocolate-Factory
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive database management system using Microsoft Accessâ„¢ for Milly's Chocolate Factory, a chain of chocolate shops. The project is divided into two sections:

**1. Database Design (Section 1)**:
  * Milly Bonka, the owner, requires a database to manage various aspects of her business, including customer orders, accounts, branches, items, employees, and dependencies.
  * Key specifications include:
    > Customer information such as company, name, address, etc.
    > Order details including order date and credit authorization status.
    > Branch details like branch number, location, and storage space.
    > Item descriptions, sizes, and types.
    > Employee information such as name, address, date of hire, etc.
  * A detailed Entity-Relationship (ER) model needs to be developed based on these specifications, ensuring proper identification of attributes and relationships. The diagram should use appropriate software tools and meet normalization requirements up to 3NF.
  
**2. Microsoft Access Implementation (Section 2)**:
  * The designed database from Section 1 is implemented using Microsoft Access.
  * System requirements include:
    > Creation of tables with specified field names, data types, descriptions, and sizes.
    > Establishment of relationships with referential integrity.
    > Population of tables with sample records for testing.
    > Development of basic and advanced queries, forms, and reports to facilitate departmental use.
    > Creation of a navigational menu using macros and addition of a splash screen.
  * Advanced queries should include additional criteria or span over multiple tables, while forms and reports should be logically chosen to meet departmental needs.

By following these guidelines, the project aims to demonstrate proficiency in database design and implementation, ensuring the efficient management of Milly's Chocolate Factory operations.
